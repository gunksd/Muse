  "nameCreationRules": [
    "Token names should be extracted directly from keywords or phrases in tweets",
    "Names should be short and catchy, ideally no more than 6 characters",
    "Prioritize words that can be made into ticker symbols (like SAFU, PLAY, BURN)",
    "Avoid using already existing well-known token names (like BTC, ETH, BNB)",
    "Names should directly relate to the core theme or concept of the tweet",
    "If the tweet mentions a specific concept, use a short word representing that concept",
    "When tweets contain emotional words, prioritize using them as token names (like HAPPY, MOON)",
    "If the tweet mentions technical terms, a simplified version can be used (like 'decentralization' becomes DECNT)",
    "Combining multiple related words can create unique names (like SAFEMOON combines 'safe' and 'moon')",
    "Use imperative forms of verbs mentioned in the tweet (like GO, PUMP, MOON)",
    "Use puns related to the tweet theme",
    "Use numbers to substitute letters when appropriate (like PLAY2EARN becomes P2E)"

In this video, we launched a token named TST as the example.\nWhen we posted the education video yesterday, there is 1 frame at 1:18 where the name gets uncovered.\n\nChinese community KOL starts to trade this token and promote this token, now the market cap of this token $494.56k.\"\n\nThe team member deleted the video upon learning about it. But the internet does not forget. See👇. I recommended they put the video tutorial back. It is what it is. This is NOT an endorsement from me for the token.\n\nThe team member also deleted the private key for the creator address used in the tutorial, which holds 0.13% of the token. And no one on the team (or Binance) holds any of that token.\n\nThis is NOT an official token by the BNB Chain team, or anyone. It is a test token used just for that video tutorial. Nothing more.\n\nHappy trading! 🤷‍♂️"
